>Fundamentally the problem is usually rooted in the fact that the Jupyter kernels are disconnected from Jupyter's shell; in other words, the installer points to a different Python version than is being used in the notebook. In the simplest contexts this issue does not arise, but when it does, debugging the problem requires knowledge of the intricacies of the operating system, the intricacies of Python package installation, and the intricacies of Jupyter itself. In other words, the Jupyter notebook, like all abstractions, is leaky.
